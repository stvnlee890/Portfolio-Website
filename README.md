# Portfolio-Website

Introduction 
Reimagined simple portfolio website constructed with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. I wanted a smooth and functional website where users can focus on the contents rather than getting lost and confused. The site is easy and intuitive to navigate through without having to wonder where the close button might be located. My goal is to create extremely thoughtful functionalities while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. I believe that less is more and anything excessive should be made with much consideration. Feel free to browse to the site and examine the code behind it!

## Installation
1.	Fork and clone this repository.
2.	Change into new directory.
3.	If you plan to make contributions, use git init to initialize your Git repository. Then create and checkout a new branch name “dev” using command git checkout -b dev.
4.	Install dependencies with npm install
5.	Open your code editor to make your contributions. Then push those to your clone with git push origin response and submit a pull request.

## User Story
*	As a user viewing my portfolio page, I want to see who this person is. I want to know where they’re headed, what they’re interested in, and how they got here. A good introduction, with maybe an image of themselves.
*	I want the app experience as simple as possible, without having overly fancy features that’ll only leave me confused trying to figure out how to navigate the site. 
*	I want the navigation bar to be shown first so I know in advance what’s expected from this page, and I want to be able to click on them just to save me time from scrolling. 
*	I want the texts and layouts to be simple, but have some fun  smooth interactive experience.
*	Design === important as functionality.

## Planning 
*	Many of the functionalities on this site were done with vanilla Javascript. These functions include:
*	The navigation scroll to content with a smooth display.
*	Click event listeners for all the modals.
*	Input listeners on the forms to store contact information. 
*	Click event listeners for links to social media page.
